Maximum depth or height of the below tree is 3.

Example TreeExample TreeRecursively calculate height of left and right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus 1.  See below pseudo code and program for details.Algorithm:See the below diagram for more clarity about execution of the recursive function maxDepth() for above example tree.Implementation:
Time Complexity:  O(n) (Please see our post Tree Traversal for details)References:

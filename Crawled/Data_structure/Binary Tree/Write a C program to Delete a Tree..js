Size of a tree is the number of elements present in the tree.  Size of the below tree is 5.
Example TreeSize() function recursively calculates the size of a tree. It works as follows:Size of a tree = Size of left subtree + 1 + Size of right subtreeAlgorithm:Time & Space Complexities:  Since this program is similar to traversal of tree, time and space complexities will be same as Tree traversal (Please see our Tree Traversal post for details)Tags: Size of a Tree, Tree Size, TreeSize

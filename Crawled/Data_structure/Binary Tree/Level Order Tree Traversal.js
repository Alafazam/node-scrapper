Mirror of a Tree: Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.


Trees in the below figure are mirror of each other

Algorithm - Mirror(tree):Program:Time & Space Complexities:  This program is similar to traversal of tree space and time complexities will be same as Tree traversal (Please see our Tree Traversal post for details)Tags: Convert to Mirror, Get the Mirror, Mirror Tree, Tree Traveral, Trees

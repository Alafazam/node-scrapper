In the previous post, we introduced Queue and discussed array implementation.  In this post, linked list implementation is discussed.  The following two main operations must be implemented efficiently.In a Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, front and rear. The front points the first item of queue and rear points to last item.enQueue() This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.deQueue() This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.Output:
Dequeued item is 30
Time Complexity: Time complexity of both operations enqueue() and dequeue() is O(1) as we only change few pointers in both operations. There is no loop in any of the operations.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed aboveAsked by Varun Bhatia.Question:
Write a recursive function treeToList(Node root) that takes an ordered binary tree and rearranges the internal pointers to make a circular doubly linked list out of the tree nodes. The”previous” pointers should be stored in the “small” field and the “next” pointers should be stored in the “large” field. The list should be arranged so that the nodes are in increasing order. Return the head pointer to the new list.This is very well explained and implemented at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/TreeListRecursion.html

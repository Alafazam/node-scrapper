Given a Binary Tree, check if all leaves are at same level or not. We strongly recommend you to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.The idea is to first find level of the leftmost leaf and store it in a variable leafLevel.  Then compare level of all other leaves with leafLevel, if same, return true, else return false. We traverse the given Binary Tree in Preorder fashion. An argument leaflevel is passed to all calls.  The value of leafLevel is initialized as 0 to indicate that the first leaf is not yet seen yet.  The value is updated when we find first leaf.   Level of subsequent leaves (in preorder) is compared with leafLevel.Output:
Leaves are at same level
Time Complexity: The function does a simple traversal of the tree, so the complexity is O(n).This article is contributed by Chandra Prakash. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.

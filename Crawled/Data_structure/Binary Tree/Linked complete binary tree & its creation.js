Given a Binary Tree where each node has following structure, write a function to populate next pointer for all nodes. The next pointer for every node should be set to point to inorder successor.Initially, all next pointers have NULL values. Your function should fill these next pointers so that they point to inorder successor.Solution (Use Reverse Inorder Traversal)
Traverse the given tree in reverse inorder traversal and keep track of previously visited node.  When a node is being visited, assign previously visited node as next.We can avoid the use of static variable by passing reference to next as paramater. Time Complexity:  O(n)Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.

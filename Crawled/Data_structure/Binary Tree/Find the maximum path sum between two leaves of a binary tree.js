Given a Binary Tree, find the deepest leaf node that is left child of its parent. For example, consider the following tree. The deepest left leaf node is the node with value 9.We strongly recommend you to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.The idea is to recursively traverse the given binary tree and while traversing, maintain “level” which will store the current node’s level in the tree. If current node is left leaf, then check if its level is more than the level of deepest left leaf seen so far. If level is more then update the result. If current node is not leaf, then recursively find maximum depth in left and right subtrees, and return maximum of the two depths. Thanks to Coder011 for suggesting this approach.Output:
The deepest left child is 9
Time Complexity: The function does a simple traversal of the tree, so the complexity is O(n).This article is contributed by Abhay Rathi. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above

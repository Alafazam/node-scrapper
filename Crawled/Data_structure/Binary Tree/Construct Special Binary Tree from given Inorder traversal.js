Given a root of a tree, and an integer k. Print all the nodes which are at k distance from root. For example, in the below tree, 4, 5 & 8 are at distance 2 from root. The problem can be solved using recursion.  Thanks to eldho  for suggesting the solution.The above program prints 4, 5 and 8.Time Complexity: O(n) where n is number of nodes in the given binary tree.Please write comments if you find the above code/algorithm incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.

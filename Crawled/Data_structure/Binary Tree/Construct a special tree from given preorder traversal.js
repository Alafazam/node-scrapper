Given a Binary Tree  and a key, write a function that returns level of the key.  For example, consider the following tree. If the input key is 3, then your function should return 1.  If the input key is 4, then your function should return 3.  And for key which is not present in key, then your function should return 0.Thanks to prandeey for suggesting the following solution.The idea is to start from the root and level as 1. If the key matches with rootâ€™s data, return level.  Else recursively call for left and right subtrees with level as level + 1.Output:Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the given Binary Tree.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.

Given a Binary Tree and a positive integer k, print all nodes that are distance k from a leaf node. Here the meaning of distance is different from previous post.  Here k distance from a leaf means k levels higher than a leaf node.  For example if k is more than height of Binary Tree, then nothing should be printed.  Expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the number nodes in the given Binary Tree.We strongly recommend to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.The idea is to traverse the tree. Keep storing all ancestors till we hit a leaf node.  When we reach a leaf node, we print the ancestor at distance k.  We also need to keep track of nodes that are already printed as output. For that we use a boolean array visited[].Output:
Nodes at distance 2 are: 3 1 
Time Complexity: Time Complexity of above code is O(n) as the code does a simple tree traversal.Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above

Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.Following is an example of SumTree.Method 1 ( Simple ) 
Get the sum of nodes in left subtree and right subtree.  Check if the sum calculated is equal to rootâ€™s data.  Also, recursively check if the left and right subtrees are SumTrees.Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst case.  Worst case occurs for a skewed tree. Method 2 ( Tricky ) 
The Method 1 uses sum() to get the sum of nodes in left and right subtrees.  The method 2 uses following rules to get the sum directly.
1) If the node is a leaf node then sum of subtree rooted with this node is equal to value of this node.
2) If the node is not a leaf node then sum of subtree rooted with this node is twice the value of this node (Assuming that the tree rooted with this node is SumTree).Time Complexity: O(n)Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.

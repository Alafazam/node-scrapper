Given a binary tree and two level numbers ‘low’ and ‘high’, print nodes from level low to level high.A Simple Method is to first write a recursive function that prints nodes of a given level number. Then call recursive function in a loop from low to high.  Time complexity of this method is O(n2)
We can print nodes in O(n) time using queue based iterative level order traversal. The idea is to do simple queue based level order traversal.  While doing inorder traversal, add a marker node at the end.  Whenever we see a marker node, we increase level number.  If level number is between low and high, then print nodes.  The following is C++ implementation of above idea.Time complexity of above method is O(n) as it does a simple level order traversal. This article is contributed by Frank.

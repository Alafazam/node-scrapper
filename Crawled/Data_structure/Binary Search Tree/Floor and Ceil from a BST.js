Given a sorted array.  Write a function that creates a Balanced Binary Search Tree using array elements.Examples:Algorithm
In the previous post, we discussed construction of BST from sorted Linked List. Constructing from sorted array in O(n) time is simpler as we can get the middle element in O(1) time. Following is a simple algorithm where we first find the middle node of list and make it root of the tree to be constructed.Following is C implementation of the above algorithm. The main code which creates Balanced BST is highlighted.Time Complexity:  O(n)
Following is the recurrance relation for sortedArrayToBST().The above recurrence can be solved using Master Theorem as it falls in case 2. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.

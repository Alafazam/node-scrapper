Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.

Rotation of the above array by 2 will make array Algorithm:Recursive Implementation:
Iterative Implementation:
Here is iterative implementation of the same algorithm.  Same utility function swap() is used here.Time Complexity: O(n)Please see following posts for other methods of array rotation:

Question:
There are two sorted arrays. First one is of size m+n containing only m elements. Another one is of size n and contains n elements. Merge these two arrays into the first array of size m+n such that the output is sorted.

Input: array with m+n elements (mPlusN[]).
NA => Value is not filled/available in array mPlusN[].  There should be n such array blocks.Input: array with n elements (N[]).
Output: N[] merged into mPlusN[] (Modified mPlusN[])
Algorithm:Implementation:Output:
2 5 7 8 9 13 15 20 25
Time Complexity: O(m+n)Please write comment if you find any bug in the above program or a better way to solve the same problem.Tags: array

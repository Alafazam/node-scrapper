For example, if the input arrays are:
arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6}
Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and Intersection as {3, 5}. Algorithm Union(arr1[], arr2[]):
For union of two arrays, follow the following merge procedure.
1) Use two index variables i and j, initial values i = 0, j = 0
2) If arr1[i] is smaller than arr2[j] then print arr1[i] and increment i.
3) If arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j] then print arr2[j] and increment j.
4) If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j.
5) Print remaining elements of the larger array.Time Complexity: O(m+n)Algorithm Intersection(arr1[], arr2[]):
For Intersection of two arrays, print the element only if the element is present in both arrays.
1) Use two index variables i and j, initial values i = 0, j = 0
2) If arr1[i] is smaller than arr2[j] then increment i.
3) If arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j] then increment j.
4) If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j.Time Complexity: O(m+n)Please write comments if you find any bug in above codes/algorithms, or find other ways to solve the same problem.

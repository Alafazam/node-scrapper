Given an array arr[0 … n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of arr[] is called Bitonic if it is first increasing, then decreasing. Write a function that takes an array as argument and returns the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.
A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty. Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty. Examples:

Input arr[] = {1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1};
Output: 6 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 6 is 1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1)

Input arr[] = {12, 11, 40, 5, 3, 1}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 12, 11, 5, 3, 1)

Input arr[] = {80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 80, 60, 30, 20, 10)

This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Let the input array be arr[] of length n. We need to construct two arrays lis[] and lds[] using Dynamic Programming solution of LIS problem.  lis[i] stores the length of the Longest Increasing subsequence ending with arr[i].  lds[i] stores the length of the longest Decreasing subsequence starting from arr[i]. Finally, we need to return the max value of lis[i] + lds[i] – 1 where i is from 0 to n-1.Following is C++ implementation of the above Dynamic Programming solution.Output:
 Length of LBS is 7

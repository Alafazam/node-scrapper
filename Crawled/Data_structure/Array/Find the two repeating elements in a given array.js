Question: An Array of integers is given, both +ve and -ve. You need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero.For the below array, program should print -80 and 85.METHOD 1 (Simple) 
For each element, find the sum of it with every other element in the array and compare sums.  Finally, return the minimum sum.ImplementationTime complexity: O(n^2)
METHOD 2 (Use Sorting) 
Thanks to baskin for suggesting this approach. We recommend to read this post  for background of this approach. Algorithm 
1) Sort all the elements of the input array.
2) Use two index variables l and r to traverse from left and right ends respectively. Initialize l as 0 and r as n-1.
3) sum = a[l] + a[r]
4) If sum is -ve, then l++
5) If sum is +ve, then râ€“
6) Keep track of abs min sum.
7) Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 while l < rImplementation
Time Complexity: complexity to sort + complexity of finding the optimum pair = O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn)Asked by Vineet

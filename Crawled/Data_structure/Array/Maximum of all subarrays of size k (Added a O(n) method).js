Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.For example, let n be 7 and array be {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6}, the answer should be 1, 3 and 6.This problem is an extended version of following problem.Find the two repeating elements in a given array Method 1 and Method 2 of the above link are not applicable as the question says O(n) time complexity and O(1) constant space. Also, Method 3 and Method 4 cannot be applied here because there can be more than 2 repeating elements in this problem. Method 5 can be extended to work for this problem. Below is the solution that is similar to the Method 5.Algorithm:Implementation:Note: The above program doesnâ€™t handle 0 case (If 0 is present in array). The program can be easily modified to handle that also. It is not handled to keep the code simple.Output:
The repeating elements are:
1  3  6Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.

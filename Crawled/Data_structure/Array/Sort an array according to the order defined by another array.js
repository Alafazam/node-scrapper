Given a function ‘int f(unsigned int x)’ which takes a non-negative integer ‘x’ as input and returns an integer as output.   The function is monotonically increasing with respect to value of x, i.e., the value of f(x+1) is greater than f(x) for every input x. Find the value ‘n’ where f() becomes positive for the first time.  Since f() is monotonically increasing, values of f(n+1), f(n+2),… must be positive and values of f(n-2), f(n-3), .. must be negative.
Find n in O(logn) time, you may assume that f(x) can be evaluated in O(1) time for any input x.A simple solution is to start from i equals to 0 and one by one calculate value of f(i) for 1, 2, 3, 4 .. etc until we find a positive f(i).  This works, but takes O(n) time.Can we apply Binary Search to find n in O(Logn) time?  We can’t directly apply Binary Search as we don’t have an upper limit or high index. The idea is to do repeated doubling until we find a positive value, i.e., check values of f() for following values until f(i) becomes positive.

  f(0) 
  f(1)
  f(2)
  f(4)
  f(8)
  f(16)
  f(32)
  ....
  ....
  f(high)
Let 'high' be the value of i when f() becomes positive for first time.
Can we apply Binary Search to find n after finding ‘high’? We can apply Binary Search now, we can use ‘high/2′ as low and ‘high’ as high indexes in binary search. The result n must lie between ‘high/2′ and ‘high’.Number of steps for finding ‘high’ is O(Logn).  So we can find ‘high’ in O(Logn) time.  What about time taken by Binary Search between high/2 and high? The value of ‘high’ must be less than 2*n.  The number of elements between high/2 and high must be O(n).  Therefore, time complexity of Binary Search is O(Logn) and overall time complexity is 2*O(Logn) which is O(Logn).Output:
The value n where f() becomes positive first is 12

You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number. A pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. Find the longest chain which can be formed from a given set of pairs.
Source: Amazon Interview | Set 2For example, if the given pairs are {{5, 24}, {39, 60}, {15, 28}, {27, 40}, {50, 90} }, then the longest chain that can be formed is of length 3, and the chain is {{5, 24}, {27, 40}, {50, 90}}This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. Following is a simple two step process.
1) Sort given pairs in increasing order of first (or smaller) element.
2) Now run a modified LIS process where we compare the second element of already finalized LIS with the first element of new LIS being constructed. The following code is a slight modification of method 2 of this post.Output:
Length of maximum size chain is 3
Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of pairs.The given problem is also a variation of Activity Selection problem and can be solved in  (nLogn) time.  To solve it as a activity selection problem, consider the first element of a pair as start time in activity selection problem, and the second element of pair as end time.

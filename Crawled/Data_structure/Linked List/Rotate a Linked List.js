Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and arrangement of data is also same.  For example Linked lists a (1->2->3) and b(1->2->3) are identical. .  Write a function to check if the given two linked lists are identical.Method 1 (Iterative)
To identify if two lists are identical, we need to traverse both lists simultaneously, and while traversing we need to compare data. 
Method 2 (Recursive)
Recursive solution code is much cleaner than the iterative code. You probably wouldnâ€™t want to use the recursive version for production code however, because it will use stack space which is proportional to the length of the listsTime Complexity: O(n) for both iterative and recursive versions. n is the length of the smaller list among a and b.Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.

A triangulation of a convex polygon is formed by drawing diagonals between non-adjacent vertices (corners) such that the diagonals never intersect.Given the mobile numeric keypad. You can only press buttons that are up, left, right or down to the current button. You are not allowed to press bottom row corner buttons (i.e. * and # ).Given a directed and two vertices ‘u’ and ‘v’ in it, find shortest path from ‘u’ to ‘v’ with exactly k edges on the path.Given a directed graph and two vertices ‘u’ and ‘v’ in it, count all possible walks from ‘u’ to ‘v’ with exactly k edges on the walk.Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence.Given a positive integer N, count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1’s.Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.Given an unsorted array, trim the array such that twice of minimum is greater than maximum in the trimmed array. Elements should be removed either end of the array.The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or downTravelling Salesman Problem (TSP): Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest pGiven a rope of length n meters, cut the rope in different parts of integer lengths in a way that maximizes product of lengths of all parts. You must make at least one cut. Assume that the length of rope is more than 2 meters.Given a set of numbers, find the Length of the Longest Arithmetic Progression (LLAP) in it.A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station.Given three strings A, B and C. Write a function that checks whether C is an interleaving of A and B.

Given an array of n positive integers. Write a program to find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the intgers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, if input is {1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5}, then output should be 106 (1 + 2 + 3 + 100), if the input array is {3, 4, 5, 10}, then output should be 22 (3 + 4 + 5 + 10) and if the input array is {10, 5, 4, 3}, then output should be 10 Solution
This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. We need a slight change in the Dynamic Programming solution of LIS problem. All we need to change is to use sum as a criteria instead of length of increasing subsequence.Following is C implementation for Dynamic Programming solution of the problem.Time Complexity: O(n^2)Source: Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence ProblemPlease write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Tags: Dynamic Programming

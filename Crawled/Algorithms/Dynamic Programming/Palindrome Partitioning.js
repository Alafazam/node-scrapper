We have discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties in Set 1 and Set 2 respectively. Let us discuss Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.
The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, length of LIS for  { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.  Optimal Substructure:
Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the LIS till index i such that arr[i] is part of LIS and arr[i] is the last element in LIS, then L(i) can be recursively written as.
L(i) = { 1 + Max ( L(j) ) } where j  < i and  arr[j] < arr[i] and if there is no such j then L(i) = 1
To get LIS of a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n
So the LIS problem has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.Overlapping Subproblems:
Following is simple recursive implementation of the LIS problem.  The implementation simply follows the recursive structure mentioned above. The value of lis ending with every element is returned using max_ending_here. The overall lis is returned using pointer to a variable max.Considering the above implementation, following is recursion tree for an array of size 4.  lis(n) gives us the length of LIS for arr[].We can see that there are many subproblems which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.  Following is a tabluated implementation for the LIS problem.Note that the time complexity of the above Dynamic Programmig (DP) solution is O(n^2) and there is a O(nLogn) solution for the LIS problem (see this). We have not discussed the nLogn solution here as the purpose of this post is to explain Dynamic Programmig with a simple example.  Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Tags: Dynamic Programming

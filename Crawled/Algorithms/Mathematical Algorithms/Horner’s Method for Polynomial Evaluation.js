Write a function that takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k). For example, your function should return 6 for n = 4 and k = 2, and it should return 10 for n = 5 and k = 2.We have discussed a O(n*k) time and O(k) extra space algorithm in this post.  The value of C(n, k) can be calculated in O(k) time and O(1) extra space.  Following implementation uses above formula to calculate C(n, k)Time Complexity: O(k)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)This article is compiled by Aashish Barnwal and reviewed by GeeksforGeeks team. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.Tags: MathematicalAlgo

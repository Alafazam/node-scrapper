Asked by Anshya.Below are the different ways to add base 14 numbers.
Method 1
Thanks to Raj for suggesting this method.Method 2
Just add the numbers in base 14 in same way we add in base 10.  Add numerals of both numbers one by one from right to left.  If there is a carry while adding two numerals, consider the carry for adding next numerals.Let us consider the presentation of base 14 numbers same as hexadecimal numbersImplementation of Method 2Notes:
Above approach can be used to add numbers in any base.  We donâ€™t have to do string operations if base is smaller than 10.You can try extending the above program for numbers of different lengths. Please comment if you find any bug in the program or a better approach to do the same.Tags: MathematicalAlgo

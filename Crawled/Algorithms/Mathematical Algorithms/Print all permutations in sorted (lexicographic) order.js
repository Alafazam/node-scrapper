Method 1 (Using Nested Loops)We can calculate power by using repeated addition.  For example to calculate 5^6.
1) First 5 times add 5, we get 25. (5^2)
2) Then 5 times add 25, we get 125. (5^3)
3) Then 5 time add 125, we get 625 (5^4)
4) Then 5 times add 625, we get 3125 (5^5)
5) Then 5 times add 3125, we get 15625 (5^6)Method 2 (Using Recursion)
Recursively add a to get the multiplication of two numbers.  And recursively multiply to get a raise to the power b.Please write comments if you find any bug in above code/algorithm, or find other ways to solve the same problem.Tags: MathematicalAlgo

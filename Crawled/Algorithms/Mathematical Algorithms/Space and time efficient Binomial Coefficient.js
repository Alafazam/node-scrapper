Given a stream of numbers, print average (or mean) of the stream at every point.  For example, let us consider the stream as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, â€¦To print mean of a stream, we need to find out how to find average when a new number is being added to the stream. To do this, all we need is count of numbers seen so far in the stream, previous average and new number.  Let n be the count, prev_avg be the previous average and x be the new number being added.  The average after including x number can be written as (prev_avg*n + x)/(n+1).The above function getAvg() can be optimized using following changes. We can avoid the use of prev_avg and number of elements by using static variables (Assuming that only this function is called for average of stream). Following is the oprimnized version.Thanks to Abhijeet Deshpande for suggesting this optimized version.

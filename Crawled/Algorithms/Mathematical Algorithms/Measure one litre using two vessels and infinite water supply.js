Given a function foo() that returns integers from 1 to 5 with equal probability, write a function that returns integers from 1 to 7 with equal probability using foo() only. Minimize the number of calls to foo() method. Also, use of any other library function is not allowed and no floating point arithmetic allowed.Solution:
We know foo() returns integers from 1 to 5.  How we can ensure that integers from 1 to 7 occur with equal probability?
If we somehow generate integers from 1 to a-multiple-of-7 (like 7, 14, 21, â€¦) with equal probability, we can use modulo division by 7 followed by adding 1 to get the numbers from 1 to 7 with equal probability.We can generate from 1 to 21 with equal probability using the following expression.
 5*foo() + foo() -5 
Let us see how above expression can be used.
1. For each value of first foo(), there can be 5 possible combinations for values of second foo(). So, there are total 25 combinations possible.
2. The range of values returned by the above equation is 1 to 25, each integer occurring exactly once.
3. If the value of the equation comes out to be less than 22, return modulo division by 7 followed by adding 1. Else, again call the method recursively. The probability of returning each integer thus becomes 1/7.The below program shows that the expression returns each integer from 1 to 25 exactly once.Output:

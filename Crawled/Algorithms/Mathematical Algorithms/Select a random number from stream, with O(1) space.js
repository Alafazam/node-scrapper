Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number.
For example, if n is 10, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7″.  If n is 20, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19″.The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so (Ref Wiki).Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes’ method:When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime.Following is C++ implementation of the above algorithm. In the following implementation,  a boolean array arr[] of size n is used to mark multiples of prime numbers.Output:
Following are the prime numbers below 30
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29

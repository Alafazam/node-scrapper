Given a radius of a circle, draw the circle without using floating point arithmetic.Following program uses a simple concept. Let the radius of the circle be r. Consider a square of size (2r+1)*(2r+1) around the circle to be drawn. Now walk through every point inside the square. For every every point (x,y), if (x, y) lies inside the circle (or x^2+ y^2 < r^2), then print it, otherwise print space.Output:

Count all possible number of groups that can be generated in this way.We strongly recommend to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.The idea is to see remainder of every element when divided by 3. A set of elements can form a group only if sun of their remainders is multiple of 3.  Since the task is to enumerate groups, we count all elements with different remainders.Output:
Required number of groups are 8

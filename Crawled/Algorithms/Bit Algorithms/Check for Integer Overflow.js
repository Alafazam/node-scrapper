Input: A array arr[] of two elements having value 0 and 1Output:  Make both elements 0. Specifications: Following are the specifications to follow.
1) It is guaranteed that one element is 0 but we do not know its position.
2) We can’t say about another element it can be 0 or 1.
3) We can only complement array elements, no other operation like and, or, multi, division, …. etc.
4) We can’t use if, else and loop constructs.
5) Obviously, we can’t directly assign 0 to array elements.There are several ways we can do it as we are sure that always one Zero is there.  Thanks to devendraiiit  for suggesting following 3 methods.Method 1Method 2Method 3
This method doesn’t even need complement.Method 4
Thanks to purvi for suggesting this method.There may be many more methods.Source: http://geeksforgeeks.org/forum/topic/google-challengePlease write comments if you find the above codes incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.

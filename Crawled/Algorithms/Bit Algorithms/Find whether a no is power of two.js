Compute n modulo d without division(/) and modulo(%) operators, where d is a power of 2 number. Let ith bit from right is set in d. For getting n modulus d, we just need to return 0 to i-1 (from right) bits of n as they are and other bits as 0.For example if n = 6 (00..110) and d = 4(00..100).  Last set bit in d is at position 3 (from right side). So we need to return last two bits of n as they are and other bits as 0, i.e., 00..010. Now doing it is so easy, guess itâ€¦.Yes, you have guessing it right. See the below program.References:

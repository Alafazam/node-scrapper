Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once. (i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once). Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.Method 1(Use Sorting)
First sort all the elements.  In the sorted array, by comparing adjacent elements we can easily get the non-repeating elements. Time complexity of this method is O(nLogn)Method 2(Use XOR)
Let x and y be the non-repeating elements we are looking for and arr[] be the input array. First calculate the XOR of all the array elements.All the bits that are set in xor will be set in one non-repeating element (x or y) and not in other. So if we take any set bit of xor and divide the elements of the array in two sets â€“ one set of elements with same bit set and other set with same bit not set.  By doing so, we will get x in one set and y in another set.  Now if we do XOR of all the elements in first set, we will get first non-repeating element, and by doing same in other set we will get the second non-repeating element.Implementation:Time Complexity: O(n)

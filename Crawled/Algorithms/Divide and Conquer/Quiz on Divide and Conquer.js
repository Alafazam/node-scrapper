We have discussed Knight’s tour and Rat in a Maze problems in Set 1 and Set 2 respectively.  Let us discuss N Queen as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking. The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.  For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.  For example following is the output matrix for above 4 queen solution.Naive Algorithm
Generate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints.Backtracking Algorithm
The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens.  In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution.  If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.Implementation of Backtracking solutionSources:
